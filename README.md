# Reskool Manifesto

## By the people, for the people

We hereby, the founder **Mohamed Amine Belachhab**, declare the creation of a pure non-profit called **Reskool**. The name, composed of two parts: "re" and "skool," emphasizes our mission: **reforming and democratizing education by making it FAIR, ACCESSIBLE & DIVERSE**.

We surely know that our mission's path is full of obstacles, some small, some big. This isn't an easy goal. However, the destination is more appealing than the route, and that's more than enough motivation for me personally and my future team to continue down the road and achieve what will not just help people in the short or middle run, but rather in the very long run.

We aren't building a corporation, nor a simple non-profit — **WE ARE BUILDING A LEGACY** that shall follow us years and decades after our death. That being said, we promise the unfortunate: **"WE AIN'T GIVING UP ON YOU."**

We, the Reskool team, are in service of the people and humanity, and are more than happy to be given this immense responsibility.

## Our Core Values

**Mission Values:** FAIRNESS, ACCESSIBILITY & DIVERSITY  
**Team Values:** DIGNITY, HONESTY, COMMITMENT, RESPONSIBILITY, ALTRUISM & VOLUNTEERING SPIRIT

These are beautiful values. However, words can be very deceiving, and that's why commitment comes into place. We promise the unfortunate:  
**"WE WILL ALWAYS BE LOYAL TO THIS AND ONLY THIS MANIFESTO IN THIS PATH THAT WE ALL SHALL TAKE IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR WORLD A BETTER ONE."**

Inspired by Islam, humanity, and the unfortunate. **By the people. For the people.**

## Our Products and Vision

### 1. Standardized Testing Revolution: The FADE System
We declare the creation of a new inclusive test called the **FAIR, ACCESSIBLE & DIVERSE EXAM: FADE**.

To achieve our claims, we refuse to stop at crude MCQs in only two subjects: Math & English. Our test will cover a variety of subjects: **Art, Sciences, Humanities, Business, Math, English, Social Sciences, Computer Science, and more**.

**FADE** measures skills across **analytical thinking, creative thinking, logical reasoning, artistic vision, and beyond** — customizable per student while maintaining core subjects: **Math, English, Science**.

**Pre-Assessment System:**  
Before students take FADE, they take preparatory tests to discover their strengths, weaknesses, and passions:

- **GATE9** for 9th graders  
- **Pre-FADE10** for 10th graders  
- **Pre-FADE11** for 11th graders  
- **Pre-FADE** for 12th graders  

These tests help students know where they should be heading for the next years and understand their natural strengths and weaknesses. Students can skip levels or take advanced tests if ready.  

**Pricing:** Pre-FADE assessments ≤ $6 USD, FADE ≤ $50 USD

### 2. School & Community Hubs
Reskool exists in schools via **Hubs**, run by a core team that grows as needed. We collaborate with teachers and clubs to run sessions, workshops, and pilot tests. All actions are documented with numbers, participation, and feedback, showing impact and accountability.

### 3. Volunteer & Humanitarian Service
We organize **speeches, workshops, tutoring, and mentorship programs**.  
We provide **study materials, PDFs, and guides** to under-resourced schools.  
Impact is tracked through **volunteer hours and measurable outcomes**, ensuring every action serves the people and humanity.

### 4. Accountability & Responsibility
We commit to high standards of **ethics, integrity, and responsibility**:

- Respond to inquiries within six months  
- Take action on initiatives within one year  
- Ensure every project is **transparent, measurable, and student-focused**

## Founder's Commitment
Reskool is my life's commitment. It is not a project or a career — it is a **promise to humanity and the students we serve**. Every decision, every action, and every resource flows from the principles in this manifesto. It defines who we are and will guide us forever, keeping our vision, integrity, and responsibility unwavering.

Every student matters. Every action counts. Every day we serve, we build a world worth leaving behind. Reskool is not just a non-profit; it is a **movement, a legacy, and a home for those committed to learning, fairness, and humanity**.

**P.S.** Reskool will always seek **new horizons**, exploring creative, technological, and innovative ways to serve students and humanity, while remaining true to our core values of fairness, accessibility, and diversity.
